# ============================================================================
# MERGE STRATEGY: Protected files during upstream sync
# ============================================================================
# These files contain OrizonLLM customizations and should NEVER be overwritten
# by upstream merges. The 'ours' merge driver keeps our version on conflicts.
#
# Note: Git's merge=ours only works when there's a conflict. For guaranteed
# protection, always use the sync scripts: ./scripts/sync-upstream.sh
# ============================================================================

# License bypass - CRITICAL: keeps enterprise features unlocked
litellm/proxy/auth/litellm_license.py merge=ours

# Branding and documentation
README.md merge=ours
CLAUDE.md merge=ours
UPDATE_PLAN.md merge=ours

# Custom scripts
scripts/check-license-changes.sh merge=ours
scripts/sync-upstream.sh merge=ours
